In order to access the credentials of your database, you have to get the container's console. Run the following command :-

"docker exec -it $container_id bash"

You are supposed to run "docker ps" to know container's id before you run the above command. Within container,read the content of the file named password.txt to access your mysql database username and password by running :-

Once your mysql username and password is known to you, you can simply login to mysql and create database accordingly.
